**A. Project Overview**  
	The purpose of the Vehicle Management System is to assist the user in entering and deleting data. As its name suggests, the Vehicle Management System is a system for fully manipulating information in the vehicle database.  
Inheritance helped me easily use objects of a super class in its sub classes.  
The composition helped me connect the driver to his cars.  
Abstraction allowed me to do things that computers normally can't do.  
**B. Class Hierarchy**  
Superclasses are primary classes that define basic properties and methods, much like a constructor.  
Subclasses are child classes that inherit the properties of their superclass and can be modified or supplemented.  
The overridden method allows me to change or somehow supplement the methods of my super class.  
There are three types of access modifiers:  
1\. Private \- can only be used within its class and nowhere else.  
2\. Public \- can be used and modified absolutely anywhere.  
3\. Protected \- only it and its subclasses can interact with these objects.  
**C. Instructions to Compile and Run**  
javac \*.java  
java Main  
**E. Reflection Section**  
Inheritance actually helped create concepts like superclass and subclass. They're used to building good code, so I think they're incredibly helpful.  
Using the override method, although I haven't used it myself, it would be possible to change the start engine and stop engine methods to something more appropriate for this type of transport.  
I haven't encountered any problems with this myself, but it bothered me that superclass objects could now be modified from a subclass.
